**TodoPolyglot: Multi-Language Todo Applications**

Welcome to TodoPolyglot! This repository is a collection of todo application implementations in various programming languages, ranging from the most common to some that are less well-known. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding how basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed across different programming environments.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of TodoPolyglot is to offer a clear, practical comparison of how the same task—managing a todo list—can be approached in different programming languages. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to explore new languages or a beginner aiming to see the similarities and differences in syntax and structure, this repository serves as a valuable learning tool.

### Features

- **Diverse Language Coverage**: Each directory in the repository corresponds to a different programming language, with a full implementation of a todo application.
- **Standardized Approach**: All implementations follow the same basic structure and functionality, making it easier to compare and contrast the languages.
- **Learning Resource**: Understand the idioms and unique features of each language through a real-world example.

### How to Use This Repository

1. **Explore**: Navigate through the directories to find the implementation in the language of your choice. Each directory contains:
   - Source code files
   - A README.md file with setup instructions
   - Example usage and screenshots, where applicable
2. **Contribute**: If you notice a language that's missing or can improve an existing implementation, feel free to contribute. Follow the contribution guidelines provided in the repository.
3. **Learn**: Use the implementations to study and understand the different programming paradigms, syntax styles, and language-specific features.

### Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to add a new language or improve an existing one, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your language or improvement.
3. **Add Your Code**: Implement the todo application following the structure of existing implementations. Include a README.md with setup and usage instructions.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your code is ready, submit a pull request to the main repository. Ensure your code is well-documented and tested.
